## Games ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the "Games for Object-Oriented Programming Practice" repository! Here you'll find a collection of simple games designed to help you practice object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and design patterns. These games are not meant to be fully-fledged and polished games, but rather learning exercises aimed at honing your OOP skills.

### Games Included

Pac-Man: A simplified version of the classic Pac-Man game, where you control Pac-Man to eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts. The ghosts move in predefined patterns, and your goal is to complete the level without being caught.

Traffic Simulation: A simulation of traffic movement on a two-lane road. Cars emerge from the left side of the screen and move horizontally to the right. You can control the movement of the cars and experience different traffic scenarios.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a practical environment for practicing and experimenting with OOP concepts. By exploring the source code of these games, you can learn about:

Class design and hierarchy
Inheritance and polymorphism
Encapsulation and data hiding
Composition and aggregation
Design patterns and their implementation
Feel free to explore the code, modify the games, or even extend them with new features to reinforce your understanding of OOP principles.

### Disclaimer
These games are developed solely for educational purposes and may not provide a complete gaming experience. The focus here is on OOP practice, so gameplay elements might be simplified or incomplete.

Let the coding and learning begin! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰
